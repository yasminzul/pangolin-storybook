				<p>Are you a lizard, a dragon, are you blue?<br>
					I am neither, I am me<br>
					My name is Rainie, but that's just me<br>
					I have brothers, sisters, many others<br>
					We roam the forests, eat the ant-pests<br>
					Come read more and learn about us!<br>
				</p>

				<p>Who am I, who am I?<br>
					Am I a smuggler, a buyer, am I fine?<br>
					You are neither, you are both<br>
					Your name is many, and you have plenty<br>
					You have food, shelter, more than ever<br>
					You roam the forests, eat my brothers<br>
					Come read more and learn about us!<br>
				</p>

				<p>Who are we, who are we?<br>
					We are water, we are air<br>
					We are earth, we're everywhere<br>
					This is us, this is us<br>
					You and I, we are us<br>
					Come read more and learn about us.<br>
