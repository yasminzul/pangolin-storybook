							<p class="s2-text1">Pangolins are a species of nocturnal scaly anteaters, found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
						</div>
			      <div class="swiper-slide">
							<img src="./gfx/expert-02/02@3x.png" alt="">
							<p class="s2-text2">Of the eight known species of pangolins, one is endemic to Malaysia – the Sunda pangolin (scientific name Manis javanica). Its name is derived from the Malay word “pengguling”, meaning “one who rolls up”. However, Malays call the animal “tenggiling”.</p>
						</div>
			      <div class="swiper-slide">
							<img src="./gfx/expert-03/03@3x.png" alt="">
							<p class="s2-text3">It uses its scales as a defence mechanism, rolling up into a tight ball when threatened, with the scales forming an armour that is almost impenetrable by predators. Even lions have been recorded unsuccessful in penetrating this scaly shield.</p>
						</div>
			      <div class="swiper-slide">
							<img src="./gfx/expert-04/04@3x.png" alt="">
							<p class="s2-text4">It has a long, sticky tongue that it uses to feed on ants and termites.</p>
						</div>
			      <div class="swiper-slide">
							<img src="./gfx/expert-05/05@3x.png" alt="">
							<p class="s2-text5">Although pangolin scales are chemically similar to human fingernails, many believe it has medicinal properties, and use it in traditional Chinese medicine. This belief has yet to be proven by modern science. Its meat is also often served as a delicacy in China and other countries in the Indochina region.</p>
						</div>
			      <div class="swiper-slide">
							<img src="./gfx/expert-06/06@3x.png" alt="">
							<p class="s2-text6">This belief fuels an unsustainable demand for pangolins, predominantly from China. Today, the pangolin is known as the most trafficked mammal on earth, and is under threat of extinction.</p>
						</div>
			      <div class="swiper-slide">
							<img src="./gfx/expert-07/07@3x.png" alt="">
							<p class="s2-text1">In Malaysia, the pangolin is listed as a “totally protected” species, meaning hunting and possession of the animal without a license can result in fines and jail time.</p>
						</div>
			      <div class="swiper-slide">
							<img src="./gfx/expert-08/08@3x.png" alt="">
							<p class="s2-text8">Pangolins, like all flora and fauna, play an important role in keeping a balanced ecosystem. They are known to be an excellent form of natural pest control, eating up to 20,000 ants or termites a day. The burrows they dig help aerate the forest soil, and other animals have been observed to use their burrows to sleep in.</p>
