					<p>“Here, these are its claw marks,” Anjang says carefully, fingers hovering above the soil. “It went this way, you see?”</p>

					<p>We could not see. To our eyes, it was just loose soil and some leaves. As Anjang tries to help us discern the tracks, Ramli is already waist deep in undergrowth, following the trail. The tracks were too old, though, and he returned empty handed.</p>

					<p>The Temiars are an indigenous people group whose traditional land sits on the northern edges of Peninsular Malaysia’s central forest spine. Even though Anjang and Ramli’s village is in the heart of the jungle, they and their hunting entourage would travel almost an hour by motorcycle to this stretch of dirt road to hunt pangolins.</p>

					<p>“All of this used to be jungle,” says Anjang of the hills around us, now stripped of its original rainforest and terraced for cash crop trees like rubber or oil palm. But those cash crops were never planted, and our indigenous guides don’t know why. They do know that it has turned the place into an easy hunting ground for pangolins.</p>

					<p>“They cross this road to look for food, then head back there to sleep,” says Anjang pointing at a distant hill still covered with rainforest. Whenever they cross the road, they leave telltale signs that experienced hunters can track.</p>

						<p>“In the past, if we felt like eating pangolins, then we will go hunt for it,” says Anjang. “It’s not like we hunt and eat it all the time.” The pangolin is so rich in mythology among the Temiars that some of the villagers tell of oral traditions that prohibit its hunting and eating. Anjang and Ramli themselves have recently stopped hunting them, citing objections from village elders and traditions.</p>

						<p>Even among these communities living in the forest, who only have tenuous links to the mainstream cash economy, the trade of pangolins is influenced by market forces as much as anything.

						<p>“In the past, prices were around RM300 per kg,” says Anjang. “Sometimes, up to RM350. Even up to RM600.”</p>

						<p>“But now, it fetches around RM100 per kg, maybe RM150 or RM50 per kg. If we hear the price is RM50 per kg, we don’t bother. But when we hear the price is RM300 per kg, that’s when we go hunting.”</p>
