					<p>We are on a jetty in Tanjung Piandang, a small fishing village perched messily along a river mouth feeding into the Melaka straits. It is a swaying jumble of wood jetties and fishing boats. The air is heavy with a peculiar mix of salt, fish and diesel.</p>

					<p>Three separate sources have mentioned this place as a hotspot for pangolin smuggling from Indonesia to Malaysia. With the work day already over for fishermen, the place felt almost deserted.</p>

					<p>He was paid RM300 (US$72) for that trip, but swore never to do it again. “There were no spare parts or backup fuel on the boat. If we had run into rough weather or some accident, we would have died out in the sea.”</p>

					<p>But for someone who took part in only one run, he seemed to know a lot about smuggling. “They don’t dock at any designated landing point,” he says. “They use walkie talkies or mobile phones to communicate with the buyer, who then gives instructions on safe places to land.”</p>

					<p>“Sometimes, at a phone call we will have to turn and land as far away as Penang.”</p>
