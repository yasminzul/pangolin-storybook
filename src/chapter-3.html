					<span class="drop-cap">I</span><p>t is Hari Raya Haji, a holy day for Muslims. Which is why at the home of a smuggler, we are treated to a generous spread of food and sweets. There is rendang chicken, lemang, an assortment of snacks, and even a dish of pasta.</p>

					<p>We dig in, because at that point, we didn’t know we were eating at the home of a smuggler. The matriarch of the household warmly urges us to eat more, but remains watchful.</p>

					<p>“It didn’t happen in this house,” she says. “It was the house behind ours, on the same property, but it is owned by a relative who lives in Thailand and rarely visits.”</p>

					<p>She is replying to our question about a 2017 seizure of 127 pangolins that our investigations reveal took place at her home address. Two Malaysian men were arrested, charged separately, and pled guilty, earning them a combined fine of RM145,000 (around US$ 35,000). They paid the fine and walked free. It is just one case out of a dozen other seizures since 2012 in this otherwise sleepy border town of Changlun, Kedah, just south of Thailand.</p>

					<p>After some small talk, we ask to look at the house in question. She agrees.</p>

					<p>It is less a house, and more like a derelict hall. Doors and windows are shut, trash and old furniture have accumulated along its corridors. ‘Enter in Peace’, says an inscription in Jawi script on the wall. A shallow pit, of unknown purpose, lies in the backyard. Everything is quiet and still under the afternoon sun.</p>

					<p>But just as we turn to leave, a car pulls into the driveway, and from it emerges a scrawny figure dressed in hip-hop culture -- snapback, chains, low-riding jeans, and a t-shirt with a Gucci logo across the chest. We barely have time to recover.</p>

					<p>“Are you here to see the property?” he is quick to ask.</p>

					<p>“No.” A beat as we assess the situation. “We want to transport goods.”</p>

					<p>“Oh,” he exclaims, as if it is a familiar situation.</p>

					<p>“Tenggiling,” we say, using the Malay word for ‘pangolin’.</p>

					<p>“Oh, tenggiling,” he exclaims, again unsurprised.</p>

					<p>We start talking business, and the conversation reveals a smuggling route that is startlingly simple. A towkay, colloquial term for ‘boss’, passes him the goods, and he arranges to bring it across the border. After the border, the towkay recovers the cargo. The smuggler doesn’t have a share in the business, he is paid piecemeal by the towkay. Half up front, another half upon crossing the border.</p>

					<blockquote class="white">“Guaranteed (safe delivery). We don’t want to get caught either, this is not a small crime.”<span>- Pangolin smuggler</span></blockquote>

					<p>He refuses to divulge his price, saying he has to discuss it with his father, who seems to be the mastermind. He “watches the line,'' says the younger smuggler.</p>

					<p>We later learn that the woman we spoke to earlier, the one whose food we ate with glee, is his mother.</p>

					<p>Can you guarantee our goods cross safely? we ask. “Guaranteed,” he replies. “We don’t want to get caught either, this is not a small crime.”</p>

					<p>Doesn’t Perhilitan (the Department of Wildlife and National Parks Peninsular Malaysia) disrupt you?</p>

					<p>Then he drops a bombshell: “That case (that was seized) was goods placed by IPK.” IPK refers to the Kedah state police headquarters, in Alor Setar. This young upstart smuggler then starts name-dropping police officers from that particular police station, officers who not only facilitate the smuggling, but according to him actually smuggle goods across themselves.</p>

					<p>One of them is his brother-in-law.</p>

					<p>He can cross that easily? “His ‘line’ goes from the Anti-Smuggling Unit, all the way to the top, everyone has been ‘kowtim’ (taken care of).</p>

					<span class="soundcite" data-url="https://cdn.rage.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Smuggler-3.m4a" data-start="0" data-end="20000" data-plays="1"> If you don’t <em>‘kowtim’</em> them, it won’t work, right? Maybe once or twice it works, but you must give them something.”</span>


					<p>“Everyone needs to eat a little, together. If we just eat everything ourselves, we won’t last long.”</p>
