But they returned with a collection of stories that would not sit inside the neat black-and-white columns of news publication, so they just wrote stories and made them less about accuracy and more about truth, and kissed them with pretty paintings and hoped they would speak to everyone young and old.</p><br> <p>And so The Pangolin and The Dark World of Trafficking was born.</p><br> <p>Produced by R.AGE.</p> </div> <div class="row image"> <img src=2fc19c35008c0c7e6dcc90233049fdff.png alt=""> </div> <div class=row> <span><strong>RAINIE THE PANGOLIN</strong></span> <p>Found by a group indigenous hunters after she carelessly left her tracks across the logging road near the hunters’ village. She was released because the hunters decided not to sell her or eat her. Although the forests in that area are ever shrinking due to logging and plantation activities, we like to think she continues to amble among the trees, where she sometimes comes across the one other pangolin the villagers say roams the same area.</p><br> <p>In honour of her survival spirit and freedom, we made her the symbol of our story. Read the full story to find out how she got her name.</p> </div> <div class="row logo"> <div class=one> <img src=e4c97039a1b5283d5055049d947d2d5c.png alt=""> <img src=cfbabbf4f599b1c19cc147fb880749e0.png alt=""> <img src=f0d3f1b27c1db9876952e955893bb555.png alt=""> <img src=7bd449ed7793a7416e252c08fe0ab35b.png alt=""> <img src=1d8b242ce4f22be193bb8762d5dc966c.png alt=""> <img src=816cd50af2e7fc71aa9f9fc9f4b764f8.png alt=""> </div> <div class=two> <img src=ea3a36e698387427b0e0d572ff559017.png alt=""> <img src=adb5456ccdeaf87bdefce8b82eab91ea.png alt=""> <img src=57c6d357c14ed2e9efa434bcdc4cf8b0.png alt=""> <img src=67b59847ab61526895324ce4f49631ab.png alt=""> <img src=04885165e1db6be337d3827a8adcf68c.png alt=""> <img src=14d27bad6affe2f9a492fafa9e9967a6.png alt=""> <img src=2de7bbac7f03a75729b9ed5a39199b73.png alt=""> </div> </div> <div class=row> <span><strong>GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT REPORTING COLLECTIVE</strong></span> <p>This project was produced as part of a collaboration with Global Environmental Reporting Collective (GERC), a group of 34 journalists and editors from 14 countries.
