Its name is derived from the Malay word “pengguling”, meaning “one who rolls up”. However, Malays call the animal “tenggiling”.</p> </div> <div class=swiper-slide> <img src=3d090e501282c871e619a8d8041701a0.png alt=""> <p class=s2-text3>It uses its scales as a defence mechanism, rolling up into a tight ball when threatened, with the scales forming an armour that is almost impenetrable by predators.

They are known to be an excellent form of natural pest control, eating up to 20,000 ants or termites a day. The burrows they dig help aerate the forest soil, and other animals have been observed to use their burrows to sleep in.</p> </div> </div> <div class=swiper-pagination></div> </div> </div> <script type="text/javascript" src="aboutpangolin.main.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="view.main.js"></script></body> </html>
